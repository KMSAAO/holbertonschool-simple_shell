.SH NAME
simple_shell \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [ no\ arguments ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B hsh
program is a simple UNIX command interpreter that reads commands from standard input and executes them.
It aims to reproduce the basic behavior of
.BR /bin/sh
for the purpose of learning process creation, parsing and environment handling.

The shell works in two modes:
.IP \(bu 2
Interactive mode: displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command.
.IP \(bu 2
Non\-interactive mode: reads commands from a pipe or a file until EOF.

For each command, the shell:
.IP 1. 3
Reads a line of input.
.IP 2. 3
Tokenizes the line into a command and its arguments.
.IP 3. 3
Searches the command in the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
.IP 4. 3
Creates a child process and executes the command using
.BR execve (2).
.IP 5. 3
Waits for the child process to finish.

.SH BUILTINS
The following builtins may be implemented:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The following environment variable is used:
.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories to search for executable files.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell returns the exit status of the last command executed, or 0 on success.
